## Documentaion

### Material for MkDocs

## Diagram Design

### Python Diagrams

[Project Link](https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/docs/getting-started/examples)

We are using the *diagrams* module for python. It offers the ability to dynamically generate dyagrams programmatically. *There is a built in (Material for MkDocs) programmatic diagram software, however initial investigations did not appear to provide as aesthetic a design as Python Diagrams*
